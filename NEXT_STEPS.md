# 🎯 Next Steps - Start Fresh

## ✅ What We Just Fixed

We **identified and solved the port conflict** that was preventing OpenWebUI from running properly.

**The Problem:** Both web app and OpenWebUI were using port 8000 → conflict!

**The Solution:** Use 3 different ports
- Port 3000: Your ASCII Art Generator web app
- Port 8000: OpenWebUI (LLM interface)
- Port 8001: Proxy server (API forwarder)

## 🚀 Do This Now

### Step 1: Stop Everything
All old services have been killed. ✓

### Step 2: Start All Services at Once

**Windows Users:**
```
1. Go to: C:\Users\desmo\AI Programs\ASCII ART Poetry
2. Double-click: start_all.bat
3. Three terminal windows will open
4. Wait 10 seconds for everything to start
```

**Mac/Linux Users:**
```bash
cd ~/AI\ Programs/ASCII\ ART\ Poetry
bash start_all.sh
```

### Step 3: Verify All Services Running

Open these URLs in your browser:

1. **Web App**: http://localhost:3000
   - Should show ASCII Art Generator UI
   - Settings button in top-right

2. **OpenWebUI**: http://localhost:8000
   - Should show login page
   - Sign in with your account

3. **Proxy**: http://localhost:8001/api/proxy
   - Should show JSON error (that's OK!)

### Step 4: Get Your API Key (2 minutes)

1. Go to: http://localhost:8000
2. **Sign in** with your OpenWebUI account
3. Click your **profile icon** (top-right)
4. Go to **Settings**
5. Click **API Keys**
6. Click **+ Create New API Key**
7. **Copy the full key** (don't close the window)

### Step 5: Save API Key in App (1 minute)

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Click ⚙️ **Settings** → **API** tab
3. **Paste your API key** in the field
4. Leave API URL as: `http://localhost:8000`
5. Click 💾 **Save Settings**

### Step 6: Test Connection (30 seconds)

1. Still in Settings panel
2. Click 🧪 **Test Connection**
3. Watch the connection log
4. Should see:
   - ✅ Proxy is running on port 8001
   - ✅ OpenWebUI is running at http://localhost:8000
   - ✅ API connection successful!

### Step 7: Generate AI ASCII Art! 🎨

1. Click 🤖 **AI Art** button
2. Type: `"A dragon breathing fire"`
3. Click ✨ **Generate**
4. Wait 10-30 seconds
5. See your AI-generated ASCII art!
