## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A local web server to run the application (due to JavaScript module usage).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/des-work/ASCII-Poetry-App.git
   cd ASCII-Art-Poetry
   ```

2. **Start a local web server.** This project uses JavaScript modules and APIs that require it to be served from a web server. **Do not open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.**

   Here are a few easy ways to start a server. Choose one:

   **Option A: Using Node.js (Recommended)**
   If you have Node.js installed, this is the simplest method.
   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```
   This will start a server and give you a local URL (like `http://localhost:3000`).

   **Option B: Using Python**
   If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in web server.
   ```bash
   # For Python 3
   python -m http.server

   # For Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer
   ```
   This will typically start a server at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Open the application in your browser.**
   Navigate to the URL provided by your local server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:8000`). The application should now load correctly.
